Here you'll store any data sets that (a) are generated during a preprocessing steps in the munge folder and (b) don't need to be regenerated every single time you analyze your data (small data sets that require little time to process can be loaded directly from the data folder)

This file should stay updated as needed and knit to reflect the last time it was updated.

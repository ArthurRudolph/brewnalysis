Here are any preprocessing or data munging code for the project. file names should begin with numbers (i.e. 01_, 02_, etc) to indicate their sequential order. The clean data that results from this code should always be saved in the cache folder.

This file should stay updated to contain descriptions of all the files found in the "munge" directory, and knit to reflect the last time it was updated.
